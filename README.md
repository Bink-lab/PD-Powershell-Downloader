## PD - Powershell Downloader

# ‚ùì What is PD?

Powershell Downloader uses a fake powershell to download any type of files, this is made for a personal project but decided to upload it to github for more people to use.

This is also usable on any computer, ( personally ill use this on a school computer ;) ).

Maybe Linux soon.

# ‚úÖ Usage


How do i use Powershell Downloader (PD)?

Once the ``FPD.exe`` is ran you should be prompted with a window asking for a download link.

The download link HAS to be a direct downloading link, such as: ``https://www.example.com/file.exe`` wich is the direct link to the download.

Its important to note that u NEED to have the ``https://`` infront of your link to ensure the link will properly work.
